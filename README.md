## What is Flutter?

A tool that allows you to build native cross-platform (iOS, Android) apps with one programming language and code base. It contains a SDK and a framework, which can be understood as widget library.

## What is Dart?

An object-oriented programming language developed by Google focuses on frontend user interface development. (Object-oriented and mixture of JS, java, and C#)

## Flutter Architecture

## Flutter vs React Native vs Ionic
There are other frameworks which can be used like Flutter.

Flutter combines Dart and Flutter to crete compiled native apps.

React Native is based on JavaScript/React.js, and is partly compiled (UI Components) Native Apps.

Ionic is only based on JavaScript and is WebView-hosted Web Apps.

## The Container()
Container contains child = content, Padding, Border and Margin

## final vs const
both for immutable values.
* final: the value does not change at the time of after initialized --> at the development phase, you don't know the value --> run time constant
* const: compile time constant

## Split widgets when it is possible.
